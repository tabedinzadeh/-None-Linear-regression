In this project, we want to check what pattern the economic index or GPD of the country "Ghana"  

follows during certain years.

Economic index data is stored as "ghana.gpd.csv". And by drawing the gpd chart by year, we realize that 

it follows the logistic pattern and we fit it with the logistic nonlinear regression.

The code of this program is stored under the name 

##"None Linear Regression.py ".
